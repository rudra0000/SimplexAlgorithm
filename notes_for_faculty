Consider the case where we have large number of inequalities making c >= d.
When we add slack variables the number of variables increases to c+d which is clearly larger than d.
Hence the c<=d condition is never violated and the simplex algorithm executes seemlessly without any issues.

On the other hand if we have large number of equalities making c>d then some of them are redundant. 
This may lead to two possible scenarios:
1. No solution exists
2. Solutions exists and the equations are not linearly independent.

For case 1, the simplex algorithm will terminate with no solution found.
For case 2, we preprocess the equations and remove redundant ones to again ensure c <= d. Now the simplex algorithm will work.
