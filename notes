Unbounded Solution: In the simplex method, if in the pivot column all the entries are negative or zero when choosing to leave the variable then the solution is unbounded. 
2. Infeasible Solution: In the simplex method, if artificial variables are present in the basis, then the solution obtained is infeasible.


the other condition that needs to be checked is if  c and d= something
ketan confirmed via an example that the above criteria written for infeaasible solution is correct and needs to be added to our code.



tasks:
- conv max to min prob by assuming certain input format and while displaying final result negate values appropriately
- deal with cases that lead to infeasible solutions 
    - c > d
    - ketan's point today (artificial problem doesn't have optimal solution)
-slack variables may lead to the formation of redundant equations ( as c <= d may occur)



problem how do we detect that a variable is allowed to be negative for instance -3 <= x1 <= 6
soln: for each variable treat it as x = u - v


problem how to remove reduundant equations after slack variables are introduced 
solution:
    write a matrix corressponding to constraints(A|b)
    reduce the augmented matrx into rref
    if a row comprises of only zeroes 
    or it has non-zero values only corresponding to slack variables delete the row( that won't work )
        why it won't work 
        2x1+3x2 <= 21
        2x1+3x2 <= 6
        if we introduce slack variables then no constraints will get removed as they are no longer redundant
    so we need to remove redundant constraints at inequality stage itself
    use O(n^2d) algo suggested by aryan, details not yet clear (about intercepts in n dimensions) -- clear
    to find all the intercepts
